  <h1>Soya Arakawa</h1>
  <p><strong>Born:</strong> 1984, Hamamatsu, Japan<br>
  <strong>Lives and works in:</strong> Krefeld, Germany</p>

  <p>Soya Arakawa studied at Kanazawa College of Art and at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf under Prof. Rita McBride. His artistic practice spans sculpture, drawing, painting, installation, and performance—including solo performances directed by himself as well as interdisciplinary collaborations in which he appears as a singer, dancer, and instrumentalist.</p>

  <p>Arakawa incorporates choreographic methods into his installations, or merges choreography with spatial arrangements. He often creates and exhibits performance scores, which sometimes serve as the basis for live performances presented in the same context. His works also play with ideas of cultural appropriation, fiction, and self-mythology.</p>
